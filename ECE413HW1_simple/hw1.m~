% (d.) I cannot see a difference in the single wavelength plots, but the
% tens of wavelengths plots show a difference in waveform for both the
% major and minor comparisons

%% Question 5 - discussion
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% (a.) I cannot hear any difference between the just and equal tempered
% major scales. I believe this is because the frequencies are so close that 
% the small difference in frequency that I cannot hear. However, when I
% play the scales simultaneously by calling soundsc without a pause, the
% beats that occur on particular notes reveal that there are differences in
% frequency.

% (b.) I cannot tell which sounds better, but I would guess that the just
% tempered scale would sound better since it is based on integer ratios

% (c.) Likewise, I cannot hear any difference between the just and equal
% tempered minor scales. Again, the difference is audible when calling
% soundsc without a pause

% (d.) Also cannot tell which sounds better, but again I would guess that
% the just tempered scale would sound better.

% (e.) The just tempered major chord does not have such pronounced beats as
% the equal tempered major chord does when played. 

% (f.) The just tempered major chord sounds better due to less pronounced
% beat frequencies.

% (g.) I cannot hear any difference between the just and equal tempered
% major chords. 

% (h.) My headphones are at school, I feel like I would have been able to
% tell the difference between the just and equal tempered scales and chords
% if I had access to headphones and not laptop speakers.
